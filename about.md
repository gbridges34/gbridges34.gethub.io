### Quick Bio about George
My name is George Bridges. I am from Greensboro and currently live in Durham (NC). I went to school at Stanford which represents the main time I have spent outside the state. I have *a lot* of pets: two dogs, one cat, six guinea pigs, six birds and a **very** small hamster that I believe is from Russia (not kidding). I **really** enjoy sports both as a player and spectator. My favorite sport to watch is, probably, football but on some days it might be basketball - it is really a toss up! Playing-wise I enjoy basketball and particularly tennis, even more so during the pandemic. I like spending time with my wife, Ashley, who is a veternarian and maybe the coolest person on the planet. Yea, I know it sounds cliched but I got lucky in terms of marital outcomes. I am close to both sides of my family here in NC and happy to be living in the Triangle!
