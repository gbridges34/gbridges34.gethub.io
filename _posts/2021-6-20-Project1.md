I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to map the names of NHL teams to their respective ID numbers. I ended up taking a very, very brute force approach that worked so far as it goes but was very inelegant. I also found it very difficult to figure out how to actually get to the useful data that came back from the stats API. It originally came back in a doubly nested data frame and I had to discover the "unnest" function in order to access. I do not believe we worried about this function in class and I do not know how else I would have gotten that job done. One thing I would do differentely is I would have started even sooner than I did. I started with a full week left to go before the deadline and had cleared out lots of time every day to work on the project but I think next time I will start as soon as I have access to the second project. Also, I learned the value of having other people to ask during this project - I made heavy use of the general channel during this project and it did a great job of getting me unstuck. I am going to make heavy, heavy use of it going forward for homework and future projects. I was not able to get my pictures to render on my site for the longest time and finally bless Adeyemi he walked me through deleting my repo and starting again. It finally worked after he was on the phone with me for an hour!
