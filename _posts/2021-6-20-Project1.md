I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to map the names of NHL teams to their respective ID numbers. I ended up taking a very, very brute force approach that worked so far as it goes but was very inelegant. I also found it very difficult to figure out how to actually get to the useful data that came back from the stats API. It originally came back in a doubly nested data frame and I had to discover the "unnest" function in order to access. I do not believe we worried about this function in class and I do not know how else I would have gotten that job done. One thing I would do differentely is I would have started even sooner than I did. I started with a full week left to go before the deadline and had cleared out lots of time every day to work on the project but I think next time I will start as soon as I have access to the second project.
