title: Blog Post # 1 (stats vs data science)!
---

My dream job using this masters degree in statistics is to work in analytics for a sports team (preferably basketball or football). I like the description of data scientists that is offered in the assigned article "Data Scientists vs Statisticians," which is that they are practicioners that follow a particular process pretty closely. Specifically this is the "data science process," which consists of several steps that are pretty straightforward to understand. These steps are, again per the same article: data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model evaluation, and data storytelling. I interpret this process as meaning that data scientists take in data into their chosen analytical framework, transform it if neccessary in order to do some initial analysis of the data before selecting what appears to be the most appropriate model based on that initial analysis
